# WeatherHW

I had so much fun with this one. I feel like I'm starting to understand so much more.

I worked mostly on the JS file with this assignment. When the user types in a city, they are then given the current temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

I did have trouble getting it to display 5 day forecast. I'd like to come back and get that fixed with my tutor.

If you enter a city and click search you are given information. The city is then saved if you typed in a new city to lookup. You can see both searched cities on your page.
